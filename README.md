# AngelHunt (WIP)
This is a project I worked on when I was taking the Intro to Meteor.js class on Coursera. The web app is a social aggregator similar to Reddit or Product Hunt that allows users to add websites they think it's useful and upvote or downvote these websites. 

When a user visits the website, s/he will need to create an account or sign in in order to add a website or post a comment. User will see a list of websites that have been added by previous visitors, the ranking of the sites and how many upvotes or downvotes each site has. User can click the arrow icons to upvote or downvote a site on AngelHunt. If user clicks "Detail", it will take him or her to the detail page where the user can see comments on a specific site.
